    " **238: Product of Array Except Self** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Problem Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array `nums`, return an array `output` such that\n",
    "`output[i] = product of all elements in nums except nums[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We **cannot use division**, and it must run in **O(n)** time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Idea — Prefix and Suffix Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of multiplying everything except `nums[i]` directly,\n",
    "We can **split the array into two parts** for each index `i`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Left product:** product of all elements *before* `i`.\n",
    "* **Right product:** product of all elements *after* `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "output[i] = left_product[i] * right_product[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1️⃣: Compute Left Products\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an array `left`.\n",
    "* `left[i]` = product of all elements **to the left** of index `i`.\n",
    "* For the first element, `left[0] = 1` (since nothing is to the left).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2️⃣: Compute Right Products\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an array `right`.\n",
    "* `right[i]` = product of all elements **to the right** of index `i`.\n",
    "* For the last element, `right[n-1] = 1` (since nothing is to the right).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3️⃣: Combine\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each index `i`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  output[i] = left[i] * right[i]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce extra space by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using the `output` array itself to store left products first.\n",
    "* Then, iterate from right to left, maintaining a running product of elements to the right, and multiply it into `output[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way → **O(n) time**, **O(1) extra space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute prefix products (left).\n",
    "* Compute suffix products (right).\n",
    "* Combine them to get the final result.\n",
    "* Optimize space by using one array and a running variable.\n",
