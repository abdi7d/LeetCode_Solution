    "#### **Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to simulate collisions of asteroids moving left (`-`) or right (`+`). A **stack** is the best way to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the full solution for your code stub:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "        stack = []\n",
    "        for asteroid in asteroids:\n",
    "            # process current asteroid\n",
    "            while stack and asteroid < 0 < stack[-1]:\n",
    "                if stack[-1] < -asteroid:   # stack top is smaller, pop it\n",
    "                    stack.pop()\n",
    "                    continue\n",
    "                elif stack[-1] == -asteroid:  # equal size, both explode\n",
    "                    stack.pop()\n",
    "                break\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                # no collision, safe to append\n",
    "                stack.append(asteroid)\n",
    "        return stack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We use a **stack** to keep track of asteroids that are moving safely.\n",
    "* If the **current asteroid** moves left (`<0`) and the **top of stack** moves right (`>0`), a collision may happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If top of stack is smaller → it explodes (`pop()`).\n",
    "  * If both are equal → both explode (pop, but don’t push the new one).\n",
    "  * If top of stack is larger → current asteroid explodes (don’t push).\n",
    "* If no collision occurs → push asteroid onto stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Run\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(Solution().asteroidCollision([5,10,-5]))   # [5, 10]\n",
    "print(Solution().asteroidCollision([8,-8]))      # []\n",
    "print(Solution().asteroidCollision([10,2,-5]))   # [10]\n",
    "```"

    "#### What is **“simulate?”** \n",
    "\n",
    "**“Simulate”** in the context of this problem (and similar problems), means:\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Step through the events one by one, in the order they would happen, and keep track of the state of the system after each step.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this problem (Asteroid Collision):\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t calculate the final state with a formula.\n",
    "Instead, we **simulate** how asteroids collide by following the rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Move through asteroids from left to right.\n",
    "2. Check: does this asteroid collide with one already moving in the opposite direction?\n",
    "3. Apply the collision rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Bigger survives,\n",
    "   * Smaller explodes,\n",
    "   * Equal size → both explode.\n",
    "4. Continue until all collisions are resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **stack** is our “simulation tool” — it keeps track of the asteroids that are still alive at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In general, in problems like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation** means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You don’t try to “jump” directly to the answer with math.\n",
    "* Instead, you **imitate** the process described in the problem, step by step.\n",
    "* You use a data structure (like a stack, queue, or array) to represent the evolving state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 Example (why it’s simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `[10, 2, -5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Put `10` → stack `[10]`.\n",
    "* Put `2` → stack `[10, 2]`.\n",
    "* See `-5`: it moves left, while `2` moves right → simulate collision:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `|2| < |5|` → `2` explodes → stack `[10]`.\n",
    "* Now check `-5` with `10`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `|10| > |5|` → `10` survives → stack `[10]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final state = `[10]`.\n",
    "👉 That step-by-step handling is the **simulation**."
